3. User verifies OTP
4. If new user, completes registration form
5. Session established with user ID stored in server-side session

### Request Lifecycle
1. User creates request with title, description, and expertise requirements
2. Request stored with urgency level and optional expert targeting
3. Relevant experts notified through dashboard
4. Experts can respond with detailed answers
5. Requester can mark responses as helpful
6. Request can be marked as resolved

### Expert Rating System
